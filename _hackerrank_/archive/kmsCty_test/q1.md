Requirement
===========

Write a pseudo code to implement the state management APIs with below requirements:

R1 - Client is able to register one or more state-flows (states, allowed actions, action handlers...) through your provided APIs.

R2 - Your APIs are able to create multiple state-flow instances from a specific state-flow, each instance is able to set the current state by name.

R3 - Client is able to fire actions on a state-flow instance, handle the actions and then go to next state.

Solution
========

Data formation
--------------

All the endpoint in our API will return JSON string as the output
The JSON format template to be

```
{
data: { some endpoint-specific JSON object are here},

error: 0, #no error
error: 1, #has error

message: 'Any message is printed here',
}
```


Requirement R1
--------------
To create a state-flow with its states set, actions on each state, and action handlers for those actions,
we will
- E1a create the state-flow
- E1b add states to the state-flow
- E1c add actions to a state
- E1d add action-handlers to an action


Requirement R2
--------------
- E2a create state-flow instance given a specific state-flow
- E2b set state for a state-flow instance



Requirement R3
--------------
- E3 fire action on a given instance


Pseudo code
-----------
Below is code written in Python the demonstrate the idea

```

  def __init__(self): pass

  actions=[] #list of StateAction objects

    return False

  switchToState=None #the target State to switch to when the action is triggered

  def save(self): pass #save object to database

  @staticmethod
  def getById(id): pass #get object in database by id

  def __init__(self): pass

  id=''
  code='' #contain code to run e.g. python code
  action=None #the StateAction that this handler attachs to


  def save(self): pass #save object to database

  def run(self): pass #the execution method to run it

  @staticmethod
  def getById(id): pass #get object in database by id


class StateFlowInstance:
  def __init__(self): pass

  id=''
  stateflow=None #the StateFlow object where this instance is created from
  state=None #the current State object of this instance

  def save(self): pass #save object to database

  @staticmethod
