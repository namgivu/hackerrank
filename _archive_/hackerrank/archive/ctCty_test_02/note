 - toan' ve dong` du; tim 2000^1000 mod 13
   2000 ~ 11 mod 13
        ~ -2 mod 13
   2000^1000 ~ (-2)^1000 ~ 2^1000 = (2^4)^250 = 16^250
                                                16      ~ 3     mod 13
                                                16^250  ~ 3^250 mod 13
                                                        ~ (3^3)^83 *3 mod 13
                                                        ~ 27^83 *3 mod 13
                                                          27    ~ 1 mod 13
                                                          27^83 ~ 1 mod 13
                                                          => final answer is 3 #TODO verify this
